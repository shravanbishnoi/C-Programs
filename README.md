## Introduction

I'm currently learning C, and this repository serves as my personal learning log. Each program is a step towards mastering C, from basic syntax and data structures to more complex algorithms and problem-solving techniques. 

## Why C?

C is a powerful, general-purpose programming language. It is fast, efficient, and provides a strong foundation for understanding more complex languages and systems. By learning C, I am building a solid base for my programming skills and future development endeavors.

## Programs

Here is a list of some of the key programs included in this repository:

- **Hello World**: The classic first program.
- **Basic I/O Operations**: Simple input and output operations.
- **Control Structures**: Programs demonstrating loops and conditionals.
- **Functions and Recursion**: Examples of function usage and recursive algorithms.
- **Data Structures**: Implementation of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and more.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting algorithms, searching techniques, and other problem-solving approaches.
- **File Handling**: Programs that demonstrate file operations in C.


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or new programs to add, please feel free to fork this repository and create a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank all the resources, tutorials, and mentors that have helped me in this learning journey. A special thanks to the open-source community for providing an abundance of knowledge and support.
