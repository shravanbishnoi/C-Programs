## Introduction

I'm currently learning C, and this repository serves as my personal learning log. Each program is a step towards mastering C, from basic syntax and data structures to more complex algorithms and problem-solving techniques. 

## Why C?

C is a powerful, general-purpose programming language. It is fast, efficient, and provides a strong foundation for understanding more complex languages and systems. By learning C, I am building a solid base for my programming skills and future development endeavors.

## Programs

Here is a list of some of the key programs included in this repository:

- **FindMinimum**: Finds minimum element index in an array of integers.
- **GCD**: Calculates GCD of two integers.
- **IsPalindrome**: Prints if the String is Palindrome OR not.
- **IsPrime**: Prints whether an input integer is prime number.
- **LongestWordInString**: Prints the length of longest word in a input String.
- **OddEven**: Checks whether an input integer is Odd OR Even.
- **SumOfDigits**: Prints sum of digits of an input integer.
- **LinearSearch**: Prints index at which the key element is present in an integer array.
- **9.CountInArray**: Prints number of times an element is occuring in an interger array.
